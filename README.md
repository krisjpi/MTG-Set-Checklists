# MTG Set Checklists

A simple checklist for Magic The Gathering card sets. Made for personal use, but feel free to fork and use to log your own collection.

I'll be adding more sets over time, mostly based on which ones I have in my own collection. Feel free to add issues and pull requests to add sets or improve formatting if you'd like.

General info on card sets have been pulled from www.scryfall.com
